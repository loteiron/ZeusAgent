"""Shared per-chat send+edit pacing budget (#116312).

sendMessage and editMessageText count against the same per-chat Telegram allowance; a stream that edits
too often while the assistant's own backend sends were also in flight tripped FloodWait (23 events).
A per-chat 1/s slot shared by both: a SEND waits for its slot (never dropped), an INTERIM edit is
skipped (the next edit shows the same text anyway), and the FINAL edit is never gated (the completed
answer is always delivered).
